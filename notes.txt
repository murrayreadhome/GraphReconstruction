try
node swap mutations (will need a change type record)
soft constraints on min distances
maybe soft constraints on max dist

add nodes rather than paths
add nodes in order from most to least constrained, and most central first. 
where central is any node where max min_dist <= half total max min_dist
constraints on nodes are updated dynamically
find most compatible min dist when adding
make propagation more efficient by stopping when min dist gets to 1. eg 
make a vector of EdgeDist for FJ, only > 2, sorted biggest first, 
then can stop when IT dist > limit in that list
