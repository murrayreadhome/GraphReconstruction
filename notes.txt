try
node swap mutations (will need a change type record)
soft constraints on min distances
maybe soft constraints on max dist

add nodes rather than paths
add nodes in order from most to least constrained, and most central first
find most compatible min dist when adding
make propagation more efficient by stopping when min dist gets to 1
